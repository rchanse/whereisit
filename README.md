I refer to this as my 'whereis' project.

Tip of the hat: Ed Howland who told me that .md files are markdowh
files - even though this is just a plain text file.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Motivation for this 'whereis project: I keep forgetting where I put
stuff and asking myself   whereis ---?

There will be two main tools  'f' and 'g'

f  is to help you find stuff by an acronym that you choose

g  is to find stuff in a list you have by number


member(s) to look at first:

a. go read next 'hearsthedeal'

b. 11asummary - one liners about the members

c. README.more.md - more extensive doc.   The INSTALL info.


You're on you own.
