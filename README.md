I refer to this as my 'whereis' project.

Tip of the hat: Ed Howland who told me that .md files are markdowh
files - even though this is just a plain text file.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Motivation for this 'whereis project: I keep forgetting where I put
stuff and asking myself   whereis ---?

There will be two main tools  'f' and 'g'

f  is to help you find stuff by an acronym that you choose

g  is to find stuff in a list you have by number

===================================================================
Please consider  ~/whereisit/bincode/README  rather than this as a
starting point.  I would have used it rather this material were I 
to present this collection of information.
